# CORE ML/DATA (From initial list - essential)
tensorflow  # or pytorch - Choose your main ML framework
numpy       # Fundamental for array/tensor operations
pandas      # Useful for loading and managing large datasets (transcripts, metadata)
tqdm        # Progress bars for training/data processing

# AUDIO PROCESSING & I/O (Crucial additions for LIVE/Streaming ASR)
librosa     # Best for robust feature extraction (MFCCs, Spectrograms)
scipy       # General scientific computing, audio file I/O
sounddevice # NEW! Recommended library for real-time microphone I/O (easier than pyaudio)
# pyaudio   # ALTERNATIVE to sounddevice - if sounddevice fails, try this.

# REAL-TIME MODEL LIBRARIES (Essential for low-latency inference)
# CHOOSE ONE OF THESE APPROACHES:

# 1. Faster Whisper (Recommended for best performance with a known model)
faster-whisper    # NEW! Optimized Whisper implementation for speed and lower latency
# openai-whisper  # Original Whisper library (kept for reference, but slower)
# transformers    # Needed if you use Hugging Face pipelines for loading models

# 2. VOSK (Alternative for extreme offline/low-resource requirements)
# vosk            # NEW! Library based on Kaldi, excellent for fast, offline, streaming ASR
# pyaudio         # Required dependency for VOSK's microphone examples

# STREAMING FRAMEWORK (For simple web demo/debugging - optional for the final website)
gradio            # NEW! Excellent for quickly creating a web interface for a live Python demo
